[noodledesk](https://noodledesk.tumblr.com) is my blog where i share my passion for poetry, learning, and art. There's a lot of helpful and wonderful stuff on the internet for learning, so I make posts about how to use Notion, share essays, articles, and learning resources I find interesting. I do a lot of personal illustration for this blog.
